<p style="color: #001a79;"> This repository contains the labs, assignments and "code along" code for the Data Representation Module 2022.</p>

<p style="color: #001a79;"><b>Assignment 1</b><a href="Assignments/Assignment_1.1.xml"> (Link)</a>:<br>
Create an XML file that stores data for a library (You can create this manually, I am not asking you to create a program to do this).<br> 
The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).<br>
Each catalogue can contain a number of books (say 2 for the purpose of this exercise).<br>
Books will have an ISBN, title and author.<br></p>
<br>
<p style="color: #001a79;"><b>Assignment 3</b><a href="Assignments/assignment03-cso.py"> (Link)</a>:<br>
Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json"<br><br>
&#8226 Upload this program to the same repository you used for the XML assignment<br>
&#8226 Save this assignment as "assignment03-cso.py"<br>
&#8226 This program should not be a long one<br>
&emsp; &#9702 I don't need you to reformat or analyse the data in any way<br>
&emsp; &#9702 It should be about 10ish lines long (I have not counted)<br>
&#8226 You will need to find the dataset in CSO.ie, try economic and then finance.<br></p>
