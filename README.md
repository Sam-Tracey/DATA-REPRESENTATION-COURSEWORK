<br><br>

<p style="color: #001a79;"> This repository contains the labs, assignments and "code along" code for the Data Representation Module 2022.</p>

<p style="color: #001a79;"><b>Assignment 1</b><a href="Assignments/Assignment_1.1.xml"> (Link)</a>:<br>
Create an XML file that stores data for a library (You can create this manually, I am not asking you to create a program to do this).<br> 
The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).<br>
Each catalogue can contain a number of books (say 2 for the purpose of this exercise).<br>
Books will have an ISBN, title and author.<br></p>
<br>
<p style="color: #001a79;"><b>Assignment 3</b><a href="Assignments/assignment03-cso.py"> (Link)</a>:<br>
Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json"<br><br>
&#8226 Upload this program to the same repository you used for the XML assignment<br>
&#8226 Save this assignment as "assignment03-cso.py"<br>
&#8226 This program should not be a long one<br>
&emsp; &#9702 I don't need you to reformat or analyse the data in any way<br>
&emsp; &#9702 It should be about 10ish lines long (I have not counted)<br>
&#8226 You will need to find the dataset in CSO.ie, try economic and then finance.<br></p>
<br>
<p style="color: #001a79;"><b>Assignment 4</b><a href="Assignments/assignment04-github.py"> (Link)</a>:<br>
Write a program in python that will read a file from a repository.<br> 
The program should then replace all the instances of the text "Andrew" with your name<br>
The program should then commit those changes and push the file back to the repository.<br>
I do not need to see your keys<br
(see lab2, to follow)<br>
    <b>Handup</b>: Save the program as assignment04-github.py to the same repository you uploaded the xml to
    <b>Marks</b>: Marks will be given for the functionality and layout of the code; I do expect minimal comments to indicate you know what the program is doing.</p>

<p style="color: #001a79;">You'll also notice that there is a folder for the data-representation-project in this repository. I have split this out into it's own separate repository but kept the original folder here just to show "commits" etc.
